Certainly, let's focus on exercises specifically related to arrays based on your current knowledge:

Exercise 1: Basic Array Operations

Create an empty array called myArray.
Add five integers of your choice to myArray.
Print the entire array.
Access and print the third element of the array.
Change the value of the second element to a new value.
Exercise 2: Array Sum

Create an array called numbers with at least 10 integers.
Write a function called sumArray that takes numbers as an argument and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.
Call the sumArray function with your numbers array and print the result.
Exercise 3: Finding Maximum and Minimum

Create an array called scores with a list of exam scores (e.g., [85, 92, 78, 90, 88]).
Write a function to find and print the maximum and minimum scores in the scores array.
Exercise 4: Array Sorting

Create an array of integers with at least 8 elements, and the elements should be unsorted.
Write code to sort the elements in ascending order using a simple sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort).
Print the sorted array.
Exercise 5: Removing Duplicates

Create an array called names with some duplicate names (e.g., ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Charlie", "Bob"]).
Write code to remove duplicates from the names array, so that only unique names remain.
Print the array with duplicates removed.
Exercise 6: Array Manipulation

Create an empty array called shoppingList.
Add at least 5 different items you need to buy to the shoppingList.
Write code to remove the last item from the list.
Write code to add a new item to the beginning of the list.
Print the modified shoppingList.
These exercises should provide you with a solid foundation for working with arrays and help you refine your skills in this area. If you have any questions or need hints for any of these exercises, please feel free to ask.
