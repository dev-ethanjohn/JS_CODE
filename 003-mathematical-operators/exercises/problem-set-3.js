/*
    Try to calculate these all yourself before coding them:

    1. What is 5 / 5?
    2. What is 5 % 5?
    3. What is 256 / 2?
    4. What is 256 % 10?

    BONUS: What are all the possible values of ANY_NUMBER % 2?
    BONUS2: What are all the possible values of ANY_NUMBER % 10?
*/

console.log(5 / 5); // 1
console.log(5 % 5); // 0
console.log(256 / 2); // 128
console.log(256 % 10); // 6

// BONUS -> Any even number divided by using % 2 will have a remainder of 0; whereas any odd number divided by 2using % 2 will have a remainder of 1
// BONUS -> Any number divided by 10 using % 10 will get a remainder based on the 1st ones digit of the number.
